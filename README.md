## Dark Web Monitoring Framework  

**Description:**  
The Dark Web Monitoring Framework is a Python-based solution designed to monitor and track illegal activities on the dark web. It utilizes the Tor network to anonymously scrape `.onion` websites for keywords related to illicit activities. The scraped data is stored in structured JSON files, which serve as the foundation for generating detailed reports. These reports categorize findings by website and keyword, making them accessible and actionable for investigative purposes.  

The project is an essential tool for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) operations, providing insights into dark web marketplaces, forums, and other hidden platforms. Its modular design allows for extensibility and ensures compliance with ethical guidelines when monitoring dark web activities.

### **Usage**  
- To scrape websites:  
  ```bash
  python3 main.py --scrape
  ```  

- To generate reports:  
  ```bash
  python3 main.py --report
  ```
